<h2>Flask powered blog site</h2><br>

Created both for learning how to develop 
responsive sites in Flask (primarily interested in backend)
and to have a site independent of third party resources such as 
analytics and CSS. <br>

This is more of a test for future plans of a site to tie together all of my services,
and potentially my own job card/invoicing solution. <br>

Using Templates from W3 for the frontend as I am mostly interested in the backend.
